# PHP OOP 1

## Setup
I suggest to open a local server using **MAMP** to open ```index.php```.

## Description
This exercise's aim is to understand **Object Oriented Programming**, **Classes** and **Constructors**.<br>
An array of movies is processed by the ```Movie``` class' constructor to creates as many Movie instances as the array length.<br>
The ```Movie``` class contains various **SET** and **GET** functions, validations are also included in some setter functions.<br>
At the end a list of each movie's info is printed in index.php.
